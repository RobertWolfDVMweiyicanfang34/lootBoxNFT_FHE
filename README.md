# LootBoxNFT-FHE: Fairness Encrypted, Trust Enabled 🎁

LootBoxNFT-FHE is an innovative NFT standard designed for creating on-chain "loot boxes" that ensure verifiable fairness in their content and opening probabilities. This project leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, enabling privacy-preserving operations that maintain the integrity and secrecy of the loot box contents.

## The Challenge: Trust in Gaming 🎮

In the rapidly evolving world of GameFi, blind box mechanisms have gained popularity for their element of surprise and excitement. However, this excitement often comes at the cost of transparency and fairness. Players frequently question the integrity of the loot they receive, leading to a lack of trust in the system. Traditional implementations of loot boxes often leave users in doubt about the probabilities assigned to different items, creating skepticism and diminishing the user experience.

## How FHE Provides the Solution 🔐

LootBoxNFT-FHE addresses these trust issues through the application of Fully Homomorphic Encryption, which is implemented using Zama's cutting-edge open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. By encrypting both the contents of the loot boxes and the probabilities of receiving each item, we can perform operations on this encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it. This ensures that the opening process is completely homomorphic and transparent, allowing anyone to verify the fairness of the result without compromising user privacy.

## Core Features ✨

- **FHE Encrypted Item Contents**: Each loot box's contents are encrypted to ensure that players cannot see what they will receive until the box is opened.
- **Verifiable Opening Process**: The entire opening process is executed using homomorphic encryption, ensuring that results are both random and can be verified by all parties.
- **Transparent Probability Distribution**: Players can trust the assigned probabilities of receiving each item, which are also FHE encrypted, preventing any manipulation or foul play.
- **GameFi Infrastructure**: Provides a standardized protocol for developers in the GameFi space to integrate transparent and fair loot box mechanics into their games.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The core component for implementing cryptographic functionality.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For managing smart contract development and deployment.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts.

## Project Structure 📂

The directory structure of the LootBoxNFT-FHE project is organized as follows:

```
lootBoxNFT_FHE/
├── contracts/
│   ├── lootBoxNFT_FHE.sol
├── scripts/
│   ├── deploy.js
├── test/
│   ├── lootBoxNFT_FHE.test.js
└── package.json
```

## Getting Started: Installation Guide ⚙️

To set up the LootBoxNFT-FHE project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these instructions:

1. **Download the project** by obtaining the files directly (do not use `git clone`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Instructions 🚀

After you have successfully installed the project dependencies, you can compile, test, and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   
2. **Run tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contract to your local blockchain**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Example Usage: Creating a Loot Box 📦

Here's a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to create a loot box using LootBoxNFT-FHE:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./lootBoxNFT_FHE.sol";

contract LootBoxDemo {
    LootBoxNFT_FHE public lootBoxContract;

    constructor(address _lootBoxAddress) {
        lootBoxContract = LootBoxNFT_FHE(_lootBoxAddress);
    }

    function createLootBox(string memory itemName, uint256 probability) public {
        lootBoxContract.createLootBox(itemName, probability); // Calls the FHE-enabled method to create a loot box
    }

    function openLootBox(uint256 boxId) public view returns (string memory) {
        return lootBoxContract.openLootBox(boxId); // Handles the opening logic with FHE verification
    }
}
```

This example illustrates a simple way to interact with the LootBoxNFT-FHE smart contract, where users can create and open loot boxes while benefiting from the security and transparency that our FHE solution provides.
